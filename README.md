touchtest
=========

This is a test to see if I can develop a web app using only phones and mobile devices for coding.

Process
-------

Created a github pages branch and set it as the default branch.

Make edits to the code from the web interface of github.

view changes on the github pages address jaforbes.github.io/touchtest

console
-------

In order to develop from a mobile device you will need to be able to read logging output.
So I've hacked together a logging interface.  That allows you to interact with your code in real time.
